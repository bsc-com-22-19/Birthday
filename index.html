        <h1>Happy Birthday 🎂</h1>

        <p>
            Happy Birthday to the one who makes my heart race and my days brighter! 🎉💕 
            You’re not just the love of my life, you’re also my favorite person to laugh with, tease, and steal kisses from. 
            I hope today is filled with all the things you love — cake, surprises, and maybe a little mischief too.
        </p>

        <p>
            You deserve the world, but since I can’t wrap that up, I’ll just keep giving you all of me — my love, my loyalty, and my endless affection. 
            Here’s to another year of adventures together, inside jokes, and moments that make us smile until our cheeks hurt. 
            I’m so lucky to celebrate you today and every day.
        </p>
